bro why are there google ads on the met office data page? and a comment saying not to delete? i'd assume it's built into one of the deployment modules / package thingies used but still? kinda mad
the website doesn't even host ads so what's it doing there? is it just for site analytics? perhaps search engine reasons?
**thought** decent chance it's built into whatever template / deployment thing they used it for and that's just where the google ads stuff would go if the website actually had ads

so source is [arcgis](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) which in itself is a product of [esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview). it's described as a 'SaaS for geospatial workflows' whatever that means.
quote from website is ` Improve decision-making by collecting and managing data, analyzing it, and easily sharing maps and apps within a connected and collaborative web geographic information system (GIS).`

ah so a small amount of further research does indeed show that a GIS is a thing (eg [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)) that basically 'does stuff to' geographic data (processing + visualisation)
