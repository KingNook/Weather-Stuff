# Weather-Stuff
Yeah idk exactly what this'll be but I wanna use the data on the MET office website to make some pretty graphs !

---
## EL PLAN
Alr so I have been browsing the MET Office website and they have a LOT of data available for sticking in nice pretty graphs

The Local Authority Climate Explorer dash uses *ember.js*; I could use that OR I could also just use *dash* (see f1 data viewer for example of use, link DOCS/DASH)

### AIMS
For now, there shall be a couple of aims: 
- [ ] Process raw data (most likely just yoink from MET Office website; stick in pandas dataframe, and check for missing values etc ie clean dataset)

Also to remember, I wanna document my process (ie take notes of what i've been doing) so i can refer to this in the future as a misc data processing example

## separate notes
so it turns out there's actually a heck ton of data that people just stick online, such as OS OpenData stuff. also a bit of a sidetrack but apparently Ordnance (as in OS) actually does refer to guns n stuff, since OS (which is apparently teh national mapping agency for GB) was originally setup to map Scotland for military reasons (source is [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey) but there's probably a proper one somewhere)
